### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aliya!

ðŸŽ“ I'm a Computer Science student at Loyola University with a strong passion for both computer science and mathematics.  
ðŸ’¡ I'm especially interested in **quantitative analysis** and **software development**, and I'm always looking for new ways to apply logic and creativity to solve real-world problems.  
ðŸ”­ Currently learning and building projects to deepen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and modern development practices.  
ðŸŒ± Outside of coding, I love exploring mathematical concepts and their applications in tech.

Let's connect and grow together in the world of tech ðŸš€
